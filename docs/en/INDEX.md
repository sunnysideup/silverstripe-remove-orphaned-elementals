# tl;dr

**Use at your own risk !**

Get rid of a ton of orphaned records.

Simply run:

```shell
vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/remove-orphaned-elements
```

and when you are happy, run it again with a confirm variable:

```shell
vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/remove-orphaned-elements confirm=1
```

And you feel like a heavy weight has been lifted from your shoulders
(or you quickly restore your last sspak from backup).
